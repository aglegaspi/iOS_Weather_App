- Weather app allows the user to enter a zipcode then displays the 7-day forecast.
- Your app should let the user input a zipcode, then see the 7-day forecast.
- Selecting a forecast should display more information about the weather for that day, along with a random image of the city matching the zip code.
- The user can favorite the image, then view a list of all of their favorited images.



There should be 3 Main View Controllers
✅ - The main weather view controller
✅ - The weather detail view controller (with city pic)
- The favorite images view controller


The MAIN view controller should have:
✅ - A CollectionView to show the forecasts
✅ - A Label that names the city for the forecast
✅ - A TextField for the user to enter the zip code
✅ - Selecting a collection view cell should segue to a weather detail view controller


The WEATHER detail view controller should have:
✅ - A Label naming the city and the forecast date
✅ - A random image of the city
✅ - A Label with a longer description of the weather
✅ - Additional information about the weather including the high, low, sunrise, sunset, windspeed and precipitation
- Selecting the "Save" bar button item should save the image to your favorites and present an alert view informing the user.


The FAVORITE images view controller should have:
- A table view that contains all of the images that have been favorited.
The image at the top should be the most recently favorited image.


Persistence
- Use UserDefaults to store the most recently searched zip code
- Use FileManager to store the images to disk


Programmatic UI
✅ - You must make at least one of your View Controller without a Storyboard or xib file, building the UI and constraints fully programmatically.


Endpoints
✅ - Dark Sky API
✅ - Pixabay API


Bonus Ideas
- Allow the user to search by the cityname or zipcode
- Allow the user to toggle whether the displays should be US or Metric. Persist this to UserDefaults
- Add animations
